# Sims4 MacOS Installer for [GShade](https://gposers.com/gshade/)
A set of scripts to bootstrap a working Sims 4 Windows install on MacOS from a blank Wineskin wrapper. Removes the requirement to purchase [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#mac) to use GShade. Supports both Origin and Steam versions.

# Install steps
Download Sims4Mac.zip from the Release page, Unzip the archive and double click install.command.
and follow the directions.

# To install GShade once Sims4 is installed.
Open Terminal and copy/paste the following command (entire line)
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoeyCluff/gshade-on-mac/master/Gshade_on_mac.sh)"
```
type W in the menu and hit enter, it in theory should handle the rest.
